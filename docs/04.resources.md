# Resources

conga-rest allows you to automatically map your application's model (or any classes) to resource
endpoints and serialize/deserialize requests and responses for them.

## Configuration

In order to map resources, you first need to configure the paths to find mapped classes within your application.

```yaml

# app/config/config.yml
rest:

    # the namespaced paths to the resource class directories
    resource:

        paths:

            # path to a directory
            - demo-bundle:model

            # path to a model file
            - other-bundle:model/User
```

## Resource Mapping

Mapping of your resources is handled by using the available REST annotations to map you class and
it's properties.

```js
/**
 * @Rest:Resource(type="user")
 */
module.exports = class User {

    /**
     * @constructor
     */
    constructor() {

        /**
         * @Rest:ID
         */
        this.id = null;

        /**
         * @Rest:Attribute
         */
        this.email = null;

        /**
         * @Rest:Attribute(expose=false)
         */
        this.password = null;

        /**
         * @Rest:Attribute
         */
        this.roles = [User.ROLE_USER];

        /**
         * @Rest:Attribute(type="Date", format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss", update=false)
         */
        this.createdAt = null;

        /**
         * @Rest:Attribute(type="Date", format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss", update=false)
         */
        this.updatedAt = null;

    }

};
```

## Annotation Reference

---

### @Rest:Resource

This annotation is required on the class level of any class that needs to be mapped. This annotation
tags it as a mapped resource and specifies the type name that will be used to identify the resource
in your API and to connect it to controllers and relationship mapping.

Example:

```js
/**
 * @Rest:Resource(type="user")
 */
class User {}
```

---

### @Rest:ID

This annotation specifies the property that is used as your resource's id.

Example:

```js

constructor() {

    /**
     * @Rest:ID
     */
    this.id = null;
}

```

---

### @Rest:Attribute

This annotation is used to identify and configure any of your class properties that need to be
exposed in your API.

Options:

| Name               | Type    | Description |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| property           | string  | the attribute name to use in API |
| expose             | boolean | is this attribute exposed in the API |
| update             | boolean | is this attribute updatable through API |
| type               | string  | the type to deserialize values to |
| setter             | string  | a method name in the class to use when deserializing values |
| format             | string  | a format to use for applicable types (Date) |

Examples:

```js

/**
 * A basic attribute that is exposed and updatable
 *
 * @Rest:Attribute
 */
this.name = null;

/**
 * An attribute that is not exposed, but able to be updated
 *
 * @Rest:Attribute(expose=false, update=true)
 */
this.password = null;

/**
 * An attribute that should be cast to a Number
 *
 * @Rest:Attribute(type="Number")
 */
this.num = null;

/**
 * An attribute that should be cast to a Date using a specific format
 *
 * @Rest:Attribute(type="Date", format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")
 */
this.createdAt = null;

```

---

### @Rest:MapAttribute

This annotation allows you to map internal values to other values to be exposed through the API.

Example:

```js
/**
 * @Rest:MapAttribute({
 *   0: "INACTIVE",
 *   1: "ACTIVE",
 *   2: "PENDING"
 * })
 */
this.status = 0;
```

---

### @Rest:Group

This annotation allows you to control the serialization and deserialization of specific attributes
for different group contexts.

Options:

| Name               | Type    | Description |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| read               | array   | the groups that are allowed to read values |
| write              | array   | the groups that are allowed to update values |

Example:

```js
/**
 * @Rest:Group(write=["ADMIN"], read=["ADMIN", "USER"])
 */
this.note = null;
```

---

### @Rest:Relationship

This annotation is used to map relationships between resources.

Options:

| Name               | Type    | Description |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| type               | string  | the type of relationship ("many" or "one") |
| relatedType        | string  | the name of the related resource type |

Examples:

```js
/**
 * @Rest:Relationship(type="many", relatedType="comment")
 */
this.comments = [];

/**
 * @Rest:Relationship(type="one", relatedType="user")
 */
this.author = null;
```
